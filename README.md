# BuriedSAFSlip2010
This BuriedSAFSlip2010 repository contains the data and software that supports the Earth and Space Science 2021 article Buried Aseismic Slip and Off-Fault Deformation on the Southernmost San Andreas Fault triggered by the 2010 El Mayor Cucapah Earthquake revealed by UAVSAR by Jay Parker, Andrea Donnellan, Roger Bilham, Lisa Grant Ludwig, Jun Wang, Marlon Pierce, Nicholas Mowery, and Susanne Janecke.

GNSS data for for Figures 1-2 and Table 2 are generated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory GNSS Time Series public repository at 

https://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/post/series.html

using the GeoGateway science portal at https://geo-gateway.org (GNSS tab).

 Typical use of the software requires download of UAVSAR data files from the Alaska Satellite facility, for example for the line SanAnd_26514_09015-001_10028-005_0354d_s01_L090HH_01: download to a fresh directory the three files

The chief analysis scripts are parseUAVSAR.py and edgar3.3.py, described here in a Unix (macOSX) environment.  Several open-source common python libraries must be resident in the system, pre-loaded by the authors using the Anaconda distribution system for Python (v3.7.8), with all compuations performed on a Macbook Pro computer in the Terminal application.

Create and descend to a fresh subdirectory for the parseUAVSAR.py stage of the processing (cleaning and downsampling the unwrapped phase data). This is invoked as follows for the data generated for this article:

$ parseUAVSAR.py -e -a -m 18 -n 18 -g 6 -j 6 -c 0.3 -u 0.7 -o SS.txt ../SanAnd_26514_09015-001_10028-005_0354d_s01_L090HH_01

This generates local output files used for edge detection: SS.txt, indx.txt, isum.txt.

For the second stage create and descend to a fresh subdirectory.  Edge detection products and estimates of gradient direction, width and slip for this article are generated by the command

$ edgar3.3.py -a 5 -m 5 -r 0.75 -s 18 ../SS.txt ../indx.txt ../isum.txt

Selected output files and data generated by GeoGateway form the basis of most of the figures for the article, as follows:
